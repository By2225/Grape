## TO DO for C Libraries

node:
- [x] A list of edges 
- [x] void pointer (data) 

edge: 
- [x] void(int) pointer (data)
- [x] node pointer (from) 
- [x] ndoe pointer (to)
 
graph: 
- [x] a list of node 

graph functions:
- [x] function prototypes
- [ ] finish writing functions

How do you implement Graphlit in C function (in argument)?
1. Add all nodes 
2. add all edges corresponding to the node 

Suggestion:
[] Semant check if the last one has a no expr, if the node is not the end, there should be no expr.
